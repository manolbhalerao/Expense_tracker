## 📌 Expense Tracker (Python + Pandas)
#Overview

This is a command-line based Expense Tracker built using Python and Pandas.
The application allows users to record, manage, and analyze personal expenses with monthly budgeting insights and category-wise summaries.

## The project demonstrates practical implementation of:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Data handling using Pandas

CSV persistence

Budget analysis logic

Date filtering & monthly summaries

## Features

✅ Add new expenses with auto-generated ID
✅ Store expenses in CSV file (persistent storage)
✅ View all expenses in tabular format
✅ Category-wise expense summary
✅ Monthly expense analysis
✅ Budget tracking with daily spending suggestion
✅ Delete expense by ID
✅ Menu-driven CLI interface

## Technologies Used

Python 3

Pandas

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

CSV File Handling

Datetime & Calendar modules

## Data Structure

Expenses are stored in a CSV file with the following columns:

Column	   Description
ID	       Auto-generated unique expense ID
Date	   Date of expense
Name	   Expense name/description
Category   Expense category
Amount	   Expense amount


## ▶ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install pandas

2️⃣ Run the Program

## Example Menu

==== Expense Tracker Menu ====
1. Add Expense
2. View All Expenses
3. Category Summary
4. Monthly Summary
5. Budget Analysis
6. Delete Expense
7. Exit


## Budget Analysis Logic

The system calculates:

Total amount spent

Remaining monthly budget

Suggested daily budget based on remaining days in current month


## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

OOP design in Python

Data manipulation using Pandas

File handling and CSV storage

Date filtering and time-based analysis

CLI-based application development
